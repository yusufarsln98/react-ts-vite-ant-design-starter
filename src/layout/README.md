# src/layout

The layout directory contains components and utilities related to the application's layout structure.

## Directory Structure

The layout directory should contain layout-related components and utilities that define the overall structure of the application.

Example:

- src/layout/
  - components/
  - utils/
  - index.ts

- src/layout/components
  - header.tsx
  - sidebar.tsx
  - footer.tsx
  - index.ts

- src/layout/utils
  - useLayout.ts
  - index.ts

Each component or utility should be focused on handling layout-specific functionality, such as:

- Page layouts
- Navigation structures
- Responsive design elements
- Layout-specific context providers

## Best Practices

- Keep layout components separate from feature-specific components
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Keep layout logic isolated from business logic
